Mrs.Marry is the principle of a Government School. 
The School has been opened after lockdown so Mrs.Marry instructed all the class teachers to conduct a surprise test to check the progress of her students.
As per instructions tests have been conducted and the answer sheets were distributed to the students. 
Upon receiving the papers Mrs.Marry asked students from all the classes to calculate their grades based on the marks they have scored in all five subjects. 
However, Students were finding it tough to calculate the percentage and find their grades accordingly.
